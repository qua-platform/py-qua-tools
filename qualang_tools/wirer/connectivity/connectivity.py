class Connectivity(ConnectivitySuperconductingQubits, ConnectivityNVCenters):
    """
    Represents the high-level wiring configuration for the supported QPU setup: superconducting qubits and NV centers.

    This class defines and stores placeholders for quantum elements (e.g., qubits and resonators)
    and specifies the wiring requirements for each of their control and readout lines. It enables
    the configuration of line types (e.g., drive, flux, resonator), their I/O roles, and associated
    frequency domains (RF or DC), as well as constraints for channel allocation.

    The API is designed to model a variety of qubit configurations, such as fixed-frequency,
    flux-tunable transmons and NV centers along with pairwise coupling mechanisms like cross-resonance and ZZ drive.
