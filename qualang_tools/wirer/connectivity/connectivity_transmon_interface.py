    Represents the high-level wiring configuration for a transmon-based QPU setup.

    This class defines and stores placeholders for quantum elements (e.g., qubits and resonators)

    the configuration of line types (e.g., drive, flux, resonator), their I/O roles, and associated
    frequency domains (RF or DC), as well as constraints for channel allocation.

    The API is designed to model a variety of qubit configurations, such as fixed-frequency and
