All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.1] - 2022-11-18
- Fix init files.

## [0.13.0] - 2022-11-18
### Added
- Multi-user Tools - A subpackage that allows several users to work simultaneously.
- Config.helper_tools - This package includes tools for writing and updating the configuration.
- Plot.fitting - This tool enables the use to fit results from qua programs.
- Bakery - Added a flag to disable the addition of an `align` to the `run` function.

### Changed
- Plot.plots - Added functions to plot results from qua programs (`plot_demodulated_data 1D and 2D`, `get_simulated_samples_by_element` and `plot_simulator_output`)
- Bakery - Now uses the more efficient `frame_rotation_2pi` instead of `frame_rotation`.

### Fixed
- Bakery - Fixed cases in which a `frame_rotation_2pi(0.0)` was added.

## [0.12.0] - 2022-08-29
### Changed
- **Breaking change!** - Waveform tools - Added a missing 2$\pi$ factor into `detuning` parameter in `drag_gaussian_pulse_waveforms` and `drag_cosine_pulse_waveforms`. 
  This will produce different results compared to previous versions, to get the same results, divide the `detuning` parameter by 2pi. Both `detuning`, `delta`, and `anharmonicity` are now expected in`Hz` rather than `rad`; a 2$\pi$ multiplication occurs in the built-in function.
- Waveform tools - Renamed argument `delta` to `anharmonicity` in `drag_gaussian_pulse_waveforms` and `drag_cosine_pulse_waveforms`. 
  `delta` is still accepted but will be deprecated in future versions.
- ConfigBuilder - renamed arguments (backward compatible) in Element and MeasureElement classes.
- ConfigBuilder - renamed AnalogOutputPort attribute channel_weights to crosstalk

### Added
- ConfigBuilder - PiecewiseConstantIntegrationWeights class.
- ConfigBuilder - added thread and Oscillator to Element class.
- ConfigBuilder - added shareable field to all ports.
- ConfigBuilder - added doc strings

### Fixed
- ConfigBuilder - measure pulse type in the configuration
- ConfigBuilder - removed offset field in DigitalOutputPort
- ConfigBuilder - DigitalInputPort's port id
- ConfigBuilder - fixed len method of Parameter when a setter is used
- Fixed dependency to be compatible with qm-qua 0.4.0

  - Constructor accepts optional input of elements to include.
  - "set_amplitude" and "update_frequency" have been renamed to "set_amplitude" and "set_frequency".
  - "digital_on" and "digital_off" no longer change elements which are not given.
  - "digital_on" and "digital_off" can accept no input, which makes them turn on and off all channels.
  - New function, "turn_off_elements" which turns off both digital and analog of the given elements.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-01-11
### Changed

## [0.3.2] - 2021-10-20
### Fixed
- Fix Ramsey example.

## [0.3.1] - 2021-10-20
### Changed
- Change play_at() behavior - play_at() will now use the latest frame & detuning.

## [0.3.0] - 2021-10-18
### Added
- Sampling rate is now tunable within the baking.
- Integration weights tool added.
- Possibility to delete samples in the baking.

## [0.2.2] - 2021-10-06
### Fixed
- Clarification in the documentation (readme.md) about the need to declare the Quantum Machine after the baking of all waveforms to ensure they are runnable within the QUA program.
- Removed Entropy dependency from XEB example.


## [0.2.1] - 2021-09-06
### Added
- Extended the method get_Op_length() which does not require a quantum element anymore, as the output of the method will be the longest baked waveform across all involved quantum elements if none is provided (specifically useful for the example of 2 qubit RB in qua-libs).
### Changed
- Updated docstrings describing the baking tool to make it more readable.
- Refined the method b.align() which was padding 0s to all elements in the config instead of only aligning elements already involved in the baking context manager when no argument was provided. This is now corrected.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-08-16
### Added
- Digital waveforms are now editable within the baking and can be attached to arbitrary baked waveforms (b.add_digital_waveform).
- Existing digital waveform can now be attached to a baked operation.
- The possibility to update the config or not is now induced directly by the providing of a baking index to adapt the length of the baked reference pulse (no update_config boolean in baking initialization required anymore).
- One can delete a baked Operation from the config using delete_baked_Op (which deletes both analog and digital baked waveforms associated to the baking object).

## [0.1.1] - 2021-08-02
### Fixed
- Fixed license metadata.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-08-02
### Added
- This release exposes the baking, RB and XEB functionality.
