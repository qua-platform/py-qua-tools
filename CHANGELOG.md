### Fixed
- simulator_tools.create_simulator_controller_connections - now deals with the case of 1 controller.

## [0.13.1] - 2022-11-18
- Fix init files.

### Changed
- **Breaking change!** - Waveform tools - Added a missing 2$\pi$ factor into `detuning` parameter in `drag_gaussian_pulse_waveforms` and `drag_cosine_pulse_waveforms`. 
  This will produce different results compared to previous versions, to get the same results, divide the `detuning` parameter by 2pi. Both `detuning`, `delta`, and `anharmonicity` are now expected in`Hz` rather than `rad`; a 2$\pi$ multiplication occurs in the built-in function.
- Waveform tools - Renamed argument `delta` to `anharmonicity` in `drag_gaussian_pulse_waveforms` and `drag_cosine_pulse_waveforms`. 
  `delta` is still accepted but will be deprecated in future versions.

## [0.2.1] - 2021-09-06
### Added

### Changed
- Updated docstrings describing the baking tool to make it more readable.
- Refined the method b.align() which was padding 0s to all elements in the config instead of only aligning elements already involved in the baking context manager when no argument was provided. This is now corrected.

### Added
- Digital waveforms are now editable within the baking and can be attached to arbitrary baked waveforms (b.add_digital_waveform).
- Existing digital waveform can now be attached to a baked operation.
- The possibility to update the config or not is now induced directly by the providing of a baking index to adapt the length of the baked reference pulse (no update_config boolean in baking initialization required anymore).
- One can delete a baked Operation from the config using delete_baked_Op (which deletes both analog and digital baked waveforms associated to the baking object).
