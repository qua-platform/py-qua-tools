# QUA Language Tools

The QUA language tools package includes various tools useful while writing QUA programs and performing experiments.

It includes:


* [QUA Loops Tools](qualang_tools/loops/README.md) - This library includes tools for parametrizing QUA for_ loops using the numpy (linspace, arange, logspace) syntaxes or by directly inputting a numpy array.
* [Plotting Tools](qualang_tools/plot/README.md) - This library includes tools to help handling plots from QUA programs.
* [Result Tools](qualang_tools/results/README.md) - This library includes tools for handling and fetching results from QUA programs.
* [Units Tools](qualang_tools/units/README.md) - This library includes tools for using units (MHz, us, mV...) and converting data to other units (demodulated data to volts for instance).
* [Analysis Tools](qualang_tools/analysis/README.md) - This library includes tools for analyzing data from experiments. 
It currently has a two-states discriminator for analyzing the ground and excited IQ blobs.
* [Multi-user tools](qualang_tools/multi_user/README.md) - This library includes tools for working with the QOP in a multi-user or multi-process setting.

* [Bakery](qualang_tools/bakery/README.md) - This library introduces a new framework for creating arbitrary waveforms and
storing them in the usual configuration file. It allows defining waveforms in a QUA-like manner while working with 1ns resolution (or higher).

* Addons:
  * [Calibrations](qualang_tools/addons/calibration/README.md) - This module allows to easily perform most of the standard single qubit calibrations from a single python file.
  * [Interactive Plot Library](qualang_tools/addons/README.md) - This package drastically extends the capabilities of matplotlib,
  enables easily editing various parts of the figure, copy-pasting data between figures and into spreadsheets, 
  fitting the data and saving the figures.
  * [assign_variables_to_element](qualang_tools/addons/variables.py) - Forces the given variables to be used by the given element thread. Useful as a workaround for when the compiler
  wrongly assigns variables which can cause gaps.

* [Config Tools](qualang_tools/config/README.md) - This package includes tools related to the QOP configuration file, including:
  * [Integration Weights Tools](qualang_tools/config/README_integration_weights_tools.md) - This package includes tools for the creation and manipulation of integration weights. 
  * [Waveform Tools](qualang_tools/config/README_waveform_tools.md) - This package includes tools for creating waveforms useful for experiments with the QOP.
  * [Config GUI](qualang_tools/config/README_config_GUI.md) - This package contains a GUI for creating and visualizing the configuration file.
  * [Config Builder](qualang_tools/config/README_config_builder.md) - This package contains an API for creating and manipulation configuration files.
  * [Config Helper Tools](qualang_tools/config/README_helper_tools.md) - This package includes tools for writing and updating the configuration.

* [Control Panel](qualang_tools/control_panel/README.md)- This package includes tools for directly controlling the OPX.
  * [ManualOutputControl](qualang_tools/control_panel/README_manual_output_control.md) - This module allows controlling the outputs from the OPX in CW mode. Once created, it has an API for defining which channels are on. Analog channels also have an API for defining their amplitude and frequency.
  * [VNA](qualang_tools/control_panel/README_vna.md) - This module allows to configure the OPX as a VNA for a given element (readout resonator for instance) and operation (readout pulse for instance) already defined in the configuration. Once created, it has an API for defining which measurements are to be run depending on the down-conversion solution used (ED: envelope detector, IR: image rejection mixer, IQ: IQ mixer).


## Installation

Install the current version using `pip`, the `--upgrade` flag ensures that you will get the latest version.

```commandline
pip install --upgrade qualang-tools
```
