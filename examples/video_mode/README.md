# Video Mode usage examples

__Package__: https://github.com/qua-platform/py-qua-tools/tree/main/qualang_tools/video_mode

This package contains modules to set the OPX in a video-mode, where pre-defined parameters of the QUA program can be 
updated while looking at data extracted and plotted in real-time. 

In this example folder, you will find two files:
* [simple test](basic_example.py): demonstrating the basic functionalities by updating two OPX output offsets.
* [PID loop](PID_example.py): showing how to use this framework to calibrate and optimize the parameters of a PID loop.
